See `STATISTICS.md` for implementation details.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Are these real statistics?
A: No, they are realistic mock data for demonstration. For real stats, visit [op.gg](https://op.gg) or [u.gg](https://u.gg).

### Q: How often are stats updated?
A: The mock data is deterministic and doesn't change. With real API integration, you could update hourly.
