# Bug Fixes & Improvements

## Fixed: Role Filtering Not Working

### Problem
When clicking role filter tabs (Top, Jungle, Middle, Bottom), no champions were displayed. The message "No champions found matching your criteria" appeared for all lanes.

### Root Cause
The champion data uses **class-based roles** (mage, support, fighter, tank, assassin, marksman) rather than **lane positions** (top, jungle, middle, bottom). The filter was trying to match lane names directly against class roles, which never matched.

### Solution
Implemented a **lane-to-role mapping system** that associates each lane with the champion classes commonly played there:

```typescript
const laneToRoleMap: Record<string, string[]> = {
  top: ['fighter', 'tank', 'slayer', 'juggernaut'],
  jungle: ['fighter', 'tank', 'assassin', 'slayer'],
  middle: ['mage', 'assassin', 'slayer', 'battlemage'],
  bottom: ['marksman', 'adc'],
  support: ['support', 'controller', 'enchanter', 'tank'],
};
```

Now when you click "Top", it shows all champions with fighter, tank, slayer, or juggernaut roles.

### Files Modified
- `lib/statistics.ts` - Updated `filterChampionsByRole()` function

## Improved: Champion URLs Now Use Names

### Problem
Champion URLs used numeric IDs (e.g., `/champions/131`), which are:
- Not SEO-friendly
- Not user-friendly
- Not memorable
- Don't match the champion being viewed

### Solution
Changed URLs to use champion names:
- **Before**: `/champions/131`
- **After**: `/champions/diana`

URLs are generated using a slug function that:
1. Converts to lowercase
2. Removes all non-alphanumeric characters
3. Creates clean, readable URLs

Examples:
- "Twisted Fate" → `/champions/twistedfate`
- "Lee Sin" → `/champions/leesin`
- "Kai'Sa" → `/champions/kaisa`
- "Cho'Gath" → `/champions/chogath`

### Files Modified
- `lib/champions.ts` - Added `getChampionByName()` and `championNameToSlug()`
- `lib/utils.ts` - Added client-safe `championNameToSlug()`
- `app/champions/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to use names instead of IDs
- `components/ChampionsList.tsx` - Updated all links to use champion names

### Benefits
- ✅ **SEO-friendly**: Search engines prefer descriptive URLs
- ✅ **User-friendly**: Users can see which champion from the URL
- ✅ **Shareable**: URLs are more meaningful when sharing
- ✅ **Memorable**: Easier to remember and type manually
- ✅ **Professional**: Matches industry standards (op.gg, u.gg, etc.)

## Technical Details

### URL Normalization
The slug function removes spaces, apostrophes, and special characters:
- Handles spaces: "Twisted Fate" → "twistedfate"
- Handles apostrophes: "Kai'Sa" → "kaisa"
- Handles periods: "Dr. Mundo" → "drmundo"
- Handles special chars: "Kog'Maw" → "kogmaw"

### Static Generation
All champion pages are still statically generated at build time using the new name-based params:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const champions = getAllChampions();
  return champions.map((champion) => ({
    id: championNameToSlug(champion.name),
  }));
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
Since this changes URLs, any bookmarks or links using old numeric IDs will need to be updated. However:
- Search engines will re-index with new URLs
- Internal links all updated automatically
- Better for long-term SEO

## Testing

### Role Filtering
Test that each role filter works:
1. Click **All** - Shows all champions
2. Click **Top** - Shows fighters, tanks (Darius, Garen, Sett, etc.)
3. Click **Jungle** - Shows junglers (Lee Sin, Graves, Kha'Zix, etc.)
4. Click **Middle** - Shows mages, assassins (Ahri, Zed, Yasuo, etc.)
5. Click **Bottom** - Shows marksmen (Jinx, Caitlyn, Ashe, etc.)
6. Click **Support** - Shows supports (Lux, Thresh, Leona, etc.)

### Champion URLs
Test that URLs work correctly:
1. Click any champion from list
2. Check URL bar shows `/champions/championname`
3. Refresh page - should load correctly
4. Copy URL and paste in new tab - should work
5. Click "Back to Champions" - returns to home

### Search + Filter
Test combined functionality:
1. Type "lee" in search → Shows Lee Sin
2. Click Top filter → No results (Lee Sin is jungle)
3. Click Jungle filter → Shows Lee Sin
4. Clear search → Shows all junglers

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Add redirects from old numeric IDs to new name URLs
- Add champion aliases (e.g., "lb" → "leblanc")
- Add meta tags for better social sharing
- Consider adding role icons to filter tabs
- Add champion role badges in grid view
